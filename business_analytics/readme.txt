Test work on analytics.

Task:

The lighting drone is an autonomous vandal-resistant flying contraption for night strolls in forest parks, which is able to find a person in the dark, follow him and light his way until he leaves the forest park. It can communicate with the drones of the same type and coalesce into a swarm, when several drones light the way for one person or vice versa, delegate lighting to another drone so that one drone illuminates the road for several people moving in the same direction. Describe the concept model for the Light Drone system as you see it. The description must include at least one diagram. Comment on significant entities and attributes. The detail and method of description is at the discretion of the performer.
