Task Description:

Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number from 1 to 8 inclusive.
It is necessary to create the program versions:

1. The program must be written in assembly language.
2. The program must be written in assembly language, the program should contain a procedure call.
3. The program must be written in assembly language, macros should be used in the program.
4. The program must be written in C++ with assembly language inline to perform mathematical calculations.

Program description:

Version 1, 2, 3 programs were created in 16-bit assembly language for OS DOS.
Version 4 is a C++ console application containing an assembly language inline.

Files Created:

1_asm/fctrl1.asm - assembly language code
2_asm_proc/fctrl2.asm - assembly language code with procedure call
3_asm_macros/fctrl3.asm - assembly language code using macro
3_asm_macros/MacrosL3.inc - macro code for version 3
4_cpp_asm/Factorial.cpp - C++ code with assembly language inline
result.png - example of result for versions 1, 2, 3
